Assets for Workload Automation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This repo provides a convenient way to maintain external file assets 
that are required to run some of the workloads in the `Workload Automation 
framework <https://github.com/jimboatarm/workload-automation/>`_.

Some of them are sizable files comparable to the framework itself, 
so this avoids bloating the main repository (and download size) for 
users that do not need the functionality.
